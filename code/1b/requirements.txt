# Requirements for minimal_polynomial_finder.py
#
# Note: This code requires SageMath (https://www.sagemath.org/)
# SageMath is not a standard Python package and must be installed separately.
#
# Installation options:
# 1. Download and install from https://www.sagemath.org/download.html
# 2. Use conda: conda install -c conda-forge sage
# 3. Use Docker: docker pull sagemath/sagemath
#
# The code uses the following SageMath modules:
# - sage.all (provides Matrix, ZZ, var, sqrt, N, etc.)
#
# Standard Python libraries used:
# - math (for mathematical constants and functions)

# If using SageMath's Python environment, no additional packages are needed.
# If running in a standard Python environment, you would need to install:
# (However, SageMath provides its own Python environment with all dependencies)

# For reference, SageMath includes:
# - NumPy
# - SciPy
# - SymPy
# - Matplotlib
# - And many other scientific computing libraries
